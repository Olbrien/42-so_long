## How to run:

You first need to install mlx on your computer.\
To do so, you can follow this [guide](https://pulgamecanica.herokuapp.com/posts/8/show) by our colleague [arosado](https://github.com/pulgamecanica).

After being installed, download the repository.\

You have two options, but to see everything you should compile with bonus.\
`make`\
`make bonus`

After compiling, just run the executable with any map situated in /so_long/maps/valid.\
`/binaries/so_long_bonus ./maps/valid/bonus/bonus4.ber`

The keys to play the game are WASD or the arrow keys.
